Greetings! 안녕하세요!

This is my personal homepage, where I share my thoughts on various topics, focusing on data-related projects, NLP, HCI, and learning through experiences. I also post illustrations that I create for fun.

I enjoy a variety of things, such as singing band songs at karaoke and drinking Einspänner chocolate lattes with my lab colleague. But above all, my favorite is playing Stardew Valley with my fisher husband.
