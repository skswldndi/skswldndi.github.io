Greetings! 안녕하세요!

I believe AI should be designed in a way that feels natural to people, rather than expecting people to adapt to AI. I see value in drawing inspiration from how people interact with each other and the world around them when designing AI.

I enjoy a variety of things, such as singing band songs at karaoke (though lately I think I prefer R&B) and drinking Einspänner chocolate lattes with my lab colleague. But above all, my favorite is playing Stardew Valley with my fisher husband.
